# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

`![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)`

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

or

```bash
uv add typer markdown
```

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

We managed project dependencies using **uv**, which provides fast and reproducible Python dependency management based on a lockfile. All required packages and exact versions are defined in the project configuration, ensuring consistent environments across all machines.

To get an exact copy of the development environment, a new team member only needs to clone the repository and run `uv sync`. This command automatically creates an isolated virtual environment and installs all dependencies.

New dependencies were added using `uv add`, which updates the project configuration and lockfile to keep the environment fully reproducible.


### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words

> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

The project was initialized using the cookiecutter template, which provided a clear and standardized structure for organizing code, data, and experiments. The main development was carried out in the `src` directory, which contains the core training, data loading, and inference logic. Model checkpoints were stored in the `models` directory, while training outputs, logs, and profiling results were saved in the `outputs` folder. The project report is stored in the `reports` directory.

We used the `configs` folder to manage experiment configurations using Hydra. Basic unit tests were implemented in a dedicated `tests` directory and executed using pytest to validate core functionality.

We deviated slightly from the original cookiecutter template to better support cloud-based workflows. Additional Dockerfiles were added to containerize training. We also added a `vertexAI` directory containing configuration files and scripts for running custom training jobs on Google Cloud Vertex AI. Furthermore, several YAML files were added in the project root to define CI/CD triggers and cloud build configurations. These deviations were necessary to support deployment, automation, and scalable cloud execution.



### Question 6

>
> Answer:

--- question 6 fill here ---

We implemented comprehensive code quality standards using **ruff** for both linting and formatting. All Python files are automatically checked and formatted through pre-commit hooks to enforce consistency before commits. Type hints are applied throughout the codebase (e.g., function signatures include parameter and return types), enabling better IDE support and early error detection. Documentation follows Google-style docstrings for all functions and classes, explaining purpose, arguments, and return values.

These practices are critical in larger projects because they prevent bugs early through static type checking, improve code maintainability by making intent explicit, and reduce onboarding time for new team members who can quickly understand code behavior. Consistent formatting eliminates style-related merge conflicts and review comments. Type hints particularly benefit collaborative development by serving as inline documentation and enabling tools to catch type mismatches before runtime. Automated enforcement through pre-commit hooks ensures standards are maintained without manual effort.

> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

--- question 9 fill here ---
Yes, we maintained a structured workflow using branches and pull requests throughout the project. Each task corresponded to a dedicated feature branch following the naming convention `{module_number}-{task_description}` (e.g., `M7-code-quality`). This approach made it easy to track which changes corresponded to which requirements. 

We enforced a frequent commit and PR cadence to keep the codebase up-to-date and minimize merge conflicts. Whenever a PR was created, the team was notified through our communication channel, ensuring visibility across the group. For PRs that modified shared code, we explicitly assigned reviewers from other team members to ensure quality control and knowledge sharing. This practice prevented siloed development, caught potential issues early, and distributed understanding of the codebase across the team. Pre-commit hooks and CI/CD checks automatically validated code quality on each PR before merging to main.

> *was because ...*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we trained our model in the cloud using Vertex AI. The training workflow was based on containerized execution to ensure reproducibility and consistency with the local development environment.

First, the training code and all dependencies were packaged into a Docker container. This container was built using Cloud Build and pushed to Artifact Registry. Training hyperparameters, such as the number of epochs, were passed as runtime arguments.

Training was triggered using a YAML configuration file that defines a Vertex AI custom training job. This configuration specifies the container image stored in Artifact Registry, the machine type used for training, and the command-line arguments passed to the training script. The model was trained for 30 epochs on the specified Vertex AI machine.

Vertex AI was chosen because it provides clean separation between code, configuration, and execution. This setup allowed us to run cloud-based training in a reproducible way.

> Example:
> *We did not manage to implement monitoring. We would like to have monitoring implemented such that over time we could*
> *measure ... and ... that would inform us about this ... behaviour of our application.*
>
> Answer:

Yes, we implemented monitoring for the deployed model. The inference service exposes custom application metrics such as request count, prediction frequency, and inference latency directly from the API. These metrics are collected using a lightweight monitoring setup integrated into the deployed service.

A metrics sidecar is used to scrape the exposed metrics and forward them to the cloud monitoring system. This allows metrics to be visualized and analyzed over time without modifying the application logic. In addition to custom metrics, standard service-level metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, request rate, and error rates are also collected automatically through Cloud Run.

Metrics such as latency and error rate can indicate issues, while prediction-related metrics can highlight unexpected usage patterns.


## Overall discussion of project

> In the following section we would like you to think about the general structure of your project.

### Question 27

> **How many credits did you end up using during the project and what service was most expensive? In general what do**
> **you think about working in the cloud?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Group member 1 used ..., Group member 2 used ..., in total ... credits was spend during development. The service*
> *costing the most was ... due to ... . Working in the cloud was ...*
>
> Answer:

The most expensive service used during the project was Vertex AI, with a total cost of approximately $5.36. This is expected, as Vertex AI was used to run container-based model training jobs in the cloud, including a full training run of 30 epochs on managed compute resources. The second largest cost came from Cloud Storage ($1.17), which was used to store datasets, model artifacts, and intermediate outputs.

Additional costs were incurred by Cloud Run ($0.67) for hosting the inference API, Artifact Registry ($0.45) for storing Docker images, and Compute Engine ($0.33), mainly due to underlying infrastructure usage. Minor costs were also associated with Cloud Build, networking, logging, and VM management, each contributing only a small fraction of the total spend.

Overall, working in the cloud was a positive experience. It enabled scalable training, reproducibility, and seamless integration between services. While training workloads can be costly, careful usage kept total spending low while still benefiting from managed cloud infrastructure.

>
> Example:

>
> Answer:

The main struggles of the project were related to building a fully reproducible end-to-end MLOps pipeline and integrating multiple tools across local and cloud environments. A significant amount of time was spent on setting up and debugging the infrastructure rather than on the model architecture itself.

One major challenge was managing data and experiments in a reproducible way. Ensuring that dataset versions, preprocessing steps, and training configurations were consistent across different runs required careful coordination between the data pipeline, configuration management, and experiment tracking. This was addressed by adopting structured configuration files and enforcing strict versioning of data and parameters.

Another time-consuming challenge was containerization and cloud training. Building Docker images that worked both locally and on Vertex AI required multiple iterations, especially when handling dependencies, environment variables, and runtime arguments. Debugging failed cloud training jobs was slower than local debugging. This was mitigated by first validating all training steps locally and using small-scale test runs before launching full cloud training jobs.

Deployment and monitoring also introduced challenges. Exposing metrics, configuring monitoring, and ensuring that the deployed service behaved correctly under load required additional effort beyond basic model serving. Incremental testing and gradual integration of monitoring components helped stabilize the deployment.

Overall, most of the project time was spent on infrastructure, automation, and debugging rather than pure model development. These challenges were overcome through iterative development, extensive testing, and a strong focus on reproducibility. While demanding, this process provided valuable experience in real-world MLOps workflows and highlighted the importance of robust tooling and automation in machine learning projects.
